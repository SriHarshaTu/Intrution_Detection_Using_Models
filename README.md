# Using a Hybrid ML Model on Network Intrusion Detection System 

 This project implements a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to prevent unauthorized access and cyberattacks. It focuses on improving existing IDS solutions by applying feature selection techniques and training predictive models to enhance detection accuracy and system efficiency.
